EviL a.k.a. `Essentially vi Lite`
=================================

EviL began file as fort of QE with more NextZXOS features. It goals are to feel both like vi, and a Next Native application while being easy for new users to learn.

Current differences to QE[^1]:
 * Renamed ;-)
 * Broken into bank based chunks, designed around app functions
 * Consistent UI with other Stale Pixels apps.
 * Persistent & runtime settings via EVIL.RC & :set, see https://github.com/StalePixels/EviL/blob/main/docs/settings.md
 * Key repeat with configurable initial, and subsequent repeat rates
 * Configurable flashing cursor
